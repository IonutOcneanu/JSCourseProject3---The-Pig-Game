# JSCourseProject3

The 3rd project from the JS course. A simple dice game (The Pig Game), for which again, I choose to do it from scratch before checking the solutions, in order to practice HTML/CSS and, of course, JS.

UPDATE: It's not the cleanest code, but I managed to get it to work by myself.

UPDATE: Since you cannot hide forms using classic JS, I had to find a workaround (z-index change).
